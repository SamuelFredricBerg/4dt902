# 4DT902 / 4DV507 | Code transformation and interpretation | 5hp | 01/09/2025 - 09/11/2025

This repository contains my implementation of and hand-ins for the assignments in the course 4DT902 - Code transformation and interpretation, given at LNU.

## Assignments description

The practical assignments in this course can be viewed as one big project, starting with lexical and syntactical analysis and ending with code translation and execution. However, we have chosen to divide the project into a few small steps that forms suitable *working units*.

* Factors that influence the grades are:

  * **Functionality: The programs should satisfy the criteria given in the practical assignment instructions.**
  * Code Structure: We expect well-structured object-oriented programs.
  * Documentation: The code as well as the whole program should be reasonably well documented.
  * Deployment: The programs should be easy to unzip, compile, and test.

* All practical assignments should be handed in electronically using the Moodle submission system. Along with the files that constitute your answers you should also submit a short text document describing your submission (e.g., specific instructions for building and running your project, if necessary). Please pack your submission into a single **ZIP archive named by your LNU user account**. For example, a zipped version of a folder named ab223cd_A1.

* **Important!**

  * A1 is individual. Each student should hand in their own solution.
  * In A2-A4 you are encouraged to work in  small groups (1-2 students). A2 and A4 are both very time consuming.
  * Apart from submitting A2-A4 in Moodle before a given deadline, we will have a follow up oral examination (or code demonstration)

### Assignments

* Assignment 1 - Building the Syntax Tree (A1)

* Assignment 2 - Symbol Table and Type Checking (A2)

* Assignment 3 - Python Code Generation (A3)

* Assignment 4 - Byte Code Generation and Interpretation (A4)

There will be special meetings associated with the practical assignment. See the course time-plan for more information or post a question on the Moodle forum if you run into trouble.

### 2nd and 3rd Attempts (Retakes)

This information is only relevant for those students that do not pass all practical assignments (A1â€“A4) in their first attempt. That is, if you don't hand in, or if you receive a grade F for any of the practical assignments that are mandatory in this course. Please hand in new (improved!) versions of all parts which you didn't pass. If you received a grade F for a given assignment, please address all comments given by the teacher regarding that assignment. (Otherwise, you will fail again)

* Deadline 2nd Attempt (Retake): November 30, 2025
* Deadline 3rd Attempt (Retake): January 11, 2026

Please contact Examinator if you have any further questions regarding the 2nd and 3rd attempts/retakes.
